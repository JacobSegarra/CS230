Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client that requested the development of an online multi-user game application. They requested design for expansion into new operating platforms and potential scaling. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I covered multiple elements of many operating platforms well. I also learned ideal operating systems for specific tasks. For example: I learned Linux is best for server functionality. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found this helpful to reduce ambiguity and refine specific functionality needs. A task is immensely easier with proper scope and clear-cut expectations. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to delve deeper into platforms I'm unfamiliar with. Particularly, Mac OS and Linux. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs were easily interpreted as many features are synonymous with games which desire online multiplayer, cross-platform, and scaling. The user's needs are paramount as it determines the success of a product. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I looked to applications that have experienced success. I think it's important not to try and reinvent the wheel, so to speak. An application can borrow ideas from other successful software and still be an original product. In the future, I would like to implement Agile principles with a team of people and create a product.
