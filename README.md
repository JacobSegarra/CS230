Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a client that requested the development of a multi-user game application. They requested design for expansion into new operating platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I covered multiple elements of many operating platforms well. I also learned ideal operating systems for specific tasks. For example: I learned Linux is best for server functionality. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
